                    In fact, the mission seems like the afterlife for me. But there is something to be done in the world. You have to work to be honest. And when it comes to working, without skill. Dreaming of doing something in life is like seeing the moon in the sky through the torn kata. InshaAllah, I will go for something in 2022.

                        I know nothing about the future. I can't even say so. But all I know is that whatever is in destiny will happen and whatever happens will be good (Allah knows me better than I do).
